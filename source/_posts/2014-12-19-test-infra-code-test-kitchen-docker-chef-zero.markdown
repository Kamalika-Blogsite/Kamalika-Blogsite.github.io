In one of my recent project we had figured out how important it is to test your infrastructure code.So here in this blog I am going to discuss in detail about the good practices and technologies that we used to do TDD for infra code.

  
In this blog I will be using three techs - "Test-kitchen, Docker and Chef" to do the demo.
This post will cover my talk in <a href="https://rootconf.in/2014/conference#1045-testing-infrastructure-code-using-test-kitchen-doc">#Rootconf - 2014</a>

The workflow and practices can be followed with other equivalent tools as well.
