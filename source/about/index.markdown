  I am an Infrastructure Automation Specialist and a senior Devops Consultant with Thoughtworks.
  I started my carrier as a System/Network Administrator and moved on to Infrastructure Automation across private and public clouds (AWS, Openstack, Cloudstack).
  I work closely with project teams to set up their project infrastructure and interact with customer IT Ops teams to ensure that our solutions seamlessly work in development and production environments.
  I am currently interested in Infrastructure and Application Security, IaaS, PaaS and Continuous delivery.
